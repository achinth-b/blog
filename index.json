It’s not just about the ability to solve a problem, or randomly blowing out techniques and technologies when solving humankind’s problems; he apprised me to have a vision about what problems that I wanted to solve, how to solve them, and most importantly, how and whom it would help. God, I should have heeded my father’s advice even during a hackathon. Anyway, as I say this after I was destroyed by my algorithms and systems midterms, at 03:00, I will tell you something. We learned that lesson, that merely thinking and churning solutions alone, unfortunately, would be useless unless our solution had direction, or drive, or a succinct goal. Now, why is this the case? Here is some context; for the first time, the organizers of DubHacks were able to provide us with feedback related to our projects. Here’s an excerpt from it (the most important one, that is). See that? Our description of our post, our marketing, our explanations, our ideas, our roadmap; none of this existed! It was partially my fault for not waking up in time in order to finish it (I really wanted to sleep after a week of slaving late nights from exams and responsbilities), but think about it. How would the idea for a yoga application that just shows you a fancy coloured stick mean to a bunch of people unless you contextualize the information, the process and the idea that it can help so many people who probably wouldn’t occur to use it for the entirety of their lives? It makes sense, now it does; why vision and a scope for your idea and your implementation is as essential as the functionality that your implementation has. Humans are nothing but creatures of communication; for language is the ultimate form of communication. We thrive when we are able to bounce ideas off of one another, create a genesis of concepts from derivative notions, we communicate through the facilitation of information across many media! If we don’t communicate our goals, if we don’t streamline a huge application’s potential to solve problems, or give people a new reason to try something new, it won’t succeed because both us the creators and them, the users, would just be completely baffled at how to approach it. So we, the designers and the coders and the managers and the people who make stuff, we need to do the contextualizing, so that everyone who wants to use it will know how to use it, and then we also know how to add what features that will create a wonderful experience. It’s a push and a pull, its a yin and a yang. Our degrees may teach us how to solve problems in a myriad of ways, but I realized one more thing: the best way for us to use our skills to solve problems, is to design products, services and goods that can solve a problem or make something better! It’s not just about proving that a graph can be disconnected at a point, or giving people a bunch of webcam sites for people on a React app, it’s about taking something that people don’t have, or don’t understand, and then putting it to context. If people understand how to use it in a defined manner, it will work wonders. Anyways, here is this post’s associated banger; and it’s been twelve whole years since this song came out. I am officially old, that when I sing this in another decade’s time, my kids will genuinely find my taste in music old and (hopefully not,) appalling. This song is literally older than the entire generation of Fortnite players. But who cares, this shit will always remain in my heart as one of the 2000s’ most quintessential songs, and one of my very first that I could sing from top to toe. achinth The first step in reaching enlightenment is knowing what you don’t know. I don’t know a lot of things. But I can learn.

My mom once told me that God gave me brains to think too much for my own good. And today, I think she’s right. I make sure I pay attention to every move, every action, every choice and every decision someone makes or something does. Maybe that’s a fault in my personal and emotional lives (I’m working on it actively) but that’s a story for another day. Today, I’m going to tell you a wondrous story about the condition of our societal hierarchy in our great continent of North America. George Floyd was a living, breathing person. A bouncer in Minneapolis. A truck driver. He worked two jobs just to lead an honest life that he tried to rebuild. Despite being convicted for armed robbery, he truly made amends for his mistakes, served time and moved to a new city for a fresh start. However, his start was promptly halted by COVID-19 and the lockdown order issues by Governor Tim Walz. I’m not sure if his job gave him unemployment security, or an emergency fund, or some semblance of covered healthcare, or even sick days to take; things I take for granted as I sit comfortably with my internship in Vancouver, Canada. But I know thousands of Americans of all creeds and colours who don’t get these benefits. Little did I realize that the lack of these services, combined with severe inequities in the availability for opportunity for disadvantaged Americans, layered the measurable and fixable biases that we humans carry on to the institutions that we uphold and thrive create a system that feels like ten-dimensional chess: no matter what move you make, there are dimensions and interactions that you don’t see unless you think ahead to a point where you just become nihilistic about this world. In our current societal structure, you have to deal with the cards you’re dealt. It could be a poor family, a dilapidated neighbourhood, the food you eat, the culture you come from or yes, the colour of your skin. Did you know that in 2015, 77% of all black American babies were born to single mothers [1]? Single mothers, who have to tend to an eight-hour-a-day job to sustain herself and her kid, with a father that is statistically more likely to either be absent or in jail. Skewed incarceration rates have already thwarted the Black family structure and intergenerational dynamic [2]. So what’s the mother going to do? Do you think this already disadvantaged American woman can raise her child in a safe space, in a nation that guarantees zero days for newborn mothers? So she might have to lose her job, or find another one, or live with someone else in some degree of poverty. She’s more likely to move to the ghettos of a city where property prices are low. Which means her child is more likely to attend an underfunded school [3]. The kid grows up in an impoverished neighbourhood, vulnerable to antisocial influences such as addictive drugs and gang violence. Our kid could have just as easily lost the game of life if they got lost here. But let’s say our child has a strong mental fortitude to say NO to all of this, but still has to work a part time job outside of his regular schoolwork (which he has to succeed in to get into a good college to do good in life, riiight?) to help sustain his single mother. This kid has no father figure or a dual, stable parenting unit to help him navigate through childhood and adolescene. So he wants to get into college. He has to write the SAT which costed US$64.50 per sitting or the ACT, which costed $67 per sitting. Maybe he doesn’t get a good score so he tried again. But he has to help his mother pay her bills, yeah? Looks like he can’t write the SAT. Or help out and volunteer at the local shelter. Or take a piano class. Or get a paid tutor to help him ace the standardized exams. Maybe he doesn’t get into a nice school so he goes to the community college. He graduates, but he won’t get a cushy job with health insurance, sick days, unemp","date":"2020-06-01","objectID":"/blog/gorge_floyd/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"The system is rigged.

After I found out that you would need to withstand the force of 10 times of my (at the time) featherweight, I decided being an astronaut was out of the window. All my childlike aspirations left the window when I my English teachers during my time in India said that I had a knack for writing and drama. Everyone found it hilarious that I wished to be involved in drama and literature (despite showing a knack in the mathematics and science fields). I don’t know why I drifted from expressing my thoughts (that’s why I’m here!), but it just sort of left me. Cue to my presence back in Canada, and I revelled in high school mathematics and science due to my accelerated curricula back in India. My teachers praised me for my control over novel concepts such as algebra in early high school, and I started taking AP classes early on in my career. I distinctly remember a teacher bringing up my knack for writing, but in an analytical context; and then I took my first statistics class. I spent an entire year learning all the introductory concepts of statistics, and I fell in love with it. It wasn’t just about the numbers, it was also about how we could expand on the numbers logically, provide explanations, insights and predictions and thoughts in an elaborate and concise manner. It was like writing a story; but here the story is trying to make sense of our world. I love statistics more than I love computer science. I would rather learn how to deal with data more than learning how to deal with backend engineering. I do not like backend engineering; I like data science. I want to make the world a better place, I want to make the world a more comfortable and safe place while advancing the world at the same time. I want to build safer self-driving cars, I want to build safer autopilots for planes, I want to build and build and tinker. I want to make the world a lot more user friendly. I want to build the world’s most accessible personal health analytics platform for the patients of the world so we can use machine learning to better understand the human body and make lives easier for all of us. If it wasn’t for my volunteer mentor Marleen, I probably wouldn’t have had a dream of creating something helpful for the people of this planet. I also want to travel the world. I want to hit every continent in the world, I want to hit every country, every castle, every sight, every beach, every skydive, every concert, every art gallery and every party. I want to see the world from the perspective of another country. I want to see what the world has to offer, and I want to see what the world can do in any nook and cranny you can find on this beautiful planet. Our dear Earth is the one unique oyster pearl in the deepest sea of the universe. Sure, there might be more pearls out there, but you won’t find anything as intricate at this one (yet). I want to go to Australia and ride a cow and pray to Uluru and see the Great Barrier Reef before it gets destroyed. I want to go to Ibiza and dance till I am sore. I want to climb Mount Rainer, and upgrade one day to K2 (I will be allowed to visit Gilgit by then, I know it) and one day; Mount Everest. I want to go to Tokyo and eat all around Shinjuku. I want to go to New Delhi and eat at every chaat stall until I am crapping for an entire day from food poisoning. I want to see every museum and art gallery in Paris and truly become inspired by creativity. I want to go to Kenya and see all the animals before the corporations destroy all of the beauty this world has to offer. I want to work in the United States and really live in the hustle-bustle rather than live comfortably in my hometown. I want to skydive in New Zealand next to the sea and feel the thrill of falling out of the sky. I want my senses stimulated, I want my senses overloaded, I want my senses to experience every joy there is to find in this world.

I don’t know what it could be; quite frankly it could be things that happens in my life, or things that I am interested in, or things that I wish to improve about myself. A journey of sorts. I’d like to think my life is worth being labelled as a journey. I like Grey’s Anatomy. I like data science. I like computers. I love ultimate. I like solving puzzles. I like being myself (sometimes). But there was once upon a time when I wanted to be a writer. As a child, I was told that my writing skills were better than most kids in my class. It was a nice ego boost, but as I grew older, I felt that seed being stifled by every other influence in my life. I had people saying that my brain was built for something more challenging, more science-y, more analytical. And my mistake was that I believed them. I thought my competency in the fields of mathematics and science would carry me into a career and foolishly continued on. But now, I think it’s time to bring that seed back and try to raise it. Maybe, I could become a more articulate individual, more capable of forming cohesive thoughts rather than running ideas parallel to one another, leaving them grossly and infantile and weak. What do you know? Simply writing my thoughts just let me figure out why I started a Medium blog. Expect more of this. I might start off with a question and I might just end up answering myself. Medium to me might just start off as a self-reflective and questioning tool, but who knows where it might end up for me? I do not know, but I want to be enlightened about it.
